            Astrology is the one that gave us the word ‘disaster’. Many believe that when the stars
            and planets are in malevolent position in our natal charts bad events or bad things would
            happen. Everyone one of us loves to avoid such bad things or disasters. The disaster is
            the impact of both natural and man-made events that influence our life and environment
            that surrounds us. Now as a general concept in academic circles, the disaster is a
            consequence of vulnerability and risk. The time often demands for appropriate reaction
            to face vulnerability and risk. The vulnerability is more in densely populated areas where
            if, a bad event strikes leads to greater damage, loss of life and is called as disaster. In
            other sparely populated area the bad event may only be a risk or hazard. Developing
            countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits – more than 95 percent of all
            deaths caused by disasters occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural
            disasters are 20 times greater as a percentage of GDP in developing countries than in
            industrialized countries. A disaster can leads to financial, environmental, or human
            losses. The resulting loss depends on the capacity of the population to support or resist
            the disaster. The term natural has consequently been disputed because the events
            simply are not hazards or disasters without human involvement.

            Any disaster can be classified either as ‘Natural’ or ‘man-made’. The most
            common natural disasters that are known to the man kind are hailstorms, thunderstorm,
            very heavy snowfall, very heavy rainfalls, squalls, gale force winds, cyclones, heat and
            cold waves, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and droughts which cause loss to
            property and life. The human induced or man-made disasters are war, accidents. Some
            of the disasters can be associated with human activities such as industrialization,
            deforestation, urbanization which invariably produce air pollution, water pollution those in
            turn cause global warming, climate change, depletion of glaciers, depletion of ozone
            layer, increase in ultraviolet radiation, avalanches, flash floods and water-logging in low
            lying areas.
